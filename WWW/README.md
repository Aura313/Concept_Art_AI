# WWW Computational Art Lab

The following are a list of desirable features for a Computational Art Lab.

The basic idea of the Computational Art Lab is as follows:

1.  The user design something like a game charaacter or clothing using text prompts, often with the help of LLMs.
2.  The website generates many stylistic variants and images related to the text.
3.  The users picks a style and the website generates many variants. For example, a shoe viewed from many angles, being wron by many models. Or a game character design sheet with the character smiling, jumping, crawling, in different outfits, etc.
4.  To automatically create design referneces or character sheets.
